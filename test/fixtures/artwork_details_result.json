    "description": "\u003Cp\u003EThis painting depicts a young woman lost in reverie after reading the letters of the ill-fated medieval lovers Heloise and Abelard. The objects on the table beside her—a letter, a sheet of music, and a book of erotic poetry—hint at a life of leisure and a susceptibility to love. In this early picture, Auguste Bernard drew upon history paintings by \u003Ca href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/36487/peter-paul-rubens\"\u003EPeter Paul Rubens\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35425/charles-le-brun\"\u003ECharles Le Brun\u003C/a\u003E, as well as Parisian traditions of genre painting and portraiture pioneered by \u003Ca href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/34738/jean-baptiste-greuze\"\u003EJean-Baptiste Greuze\u003C/a\u003E. Bernard worked in Paris in the early 1780s and studied in Italy for several years. Upon his return to Paris, he found his career frustrated by the French Revolution and the emergent fashion for the more austere Neoclassical style.\u003C/p\u003E\n",
